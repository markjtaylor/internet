				<h3>Adapting mesh to the flowfield</h3>
			</header>

            <p>	One of the big challenges of transient CFD is the amount of
            elapsed time and computer hardware resource required to achieve a
            time accurate result. Another frustration is when you have
            completed your simulation you discover that your mesh resolution
            was inadequate and you have to do it all again.  Our directors <a
                href="/the_team" target="_blank">Matthew Piggot</a>
            and <a href="/the_team" target="_blank">Gerard Gorman</a>
            are world experts in the deployment of adaptive mesh in complex
            flow regimes including aerodynamics, multi-phase flow,
            turbomachinery in the presence of eroding particles and geophysics.
            In the example shown in the picture above we show a lock about to
            open with the liquid in blue on the left (this is a multi-phase
            flow). In the initial set up both liquid and air (in yellow) are at
            rest so we only need a very coarse mesh for the main body of the
            flow but a refinement in the interface.  </p> <a href="#"
                class="image featured"><img
                src="/images/adaptive-pics/lock2.png" alt="#"/></a> <p>Now we
            release the lock gate and see the mesh refinement immediately
            respond to changes in the interface plane resolving the complex
            vortical structures in great detail with no user input. A a-priori
            unadapted mesh strategy would have been a major challenge to create
            (as well as being very large and expensive) to guarantee capturing
            all of these fine details correctly which is essential for
            accurately predicting the evolution of this flow in time.  </p> <a
                href="#" class="image featured"><img
                src="/images/adaptive-pics/lock3.png" alt="#"/></a> <p> In this
            picture we can see how the mesh size has dramatically increased
            from the initial condition (our first image above) in order to be
            able to accurately capture the full complex interface as the liquid
            approaches the far wall of the tank. </p>

				<h3>And coarsen again for computational efficiency</h3>
			</header>

            <p> Look carefully at the air (yellow) region on the left hand side
            and compare with the same region in the previous picture. Note how
            this region of air has significantly coarsened as the liquid
            migrates to the right hand side which save computational effort, as
            the computational expense is proportional to the number of mesh
            cells. We will be bringing this technology to our LCS-FAST solver
            in both single and multi-phase flow applications.</p>
