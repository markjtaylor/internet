			<h3>A new class of track car</h3>
			</header>

            <p><a href="http://elementalcars.co.uk" target ="_blank">Elemental
                Cars</a> are an advanced track car manufacturer which started
            producing the RP1 in June 2016. This stunning new product  weighs
            in at just 580 kilogrammes with 320 bhp and a 0-60 mph time of just
            2.8 seconds. More impressively it does this as a road-legal vehicle
            with room for a passenger and storage space for the shopping.  One
            problem you have with such prodigious power in such a light chassis
            is matching the cornering performance to the stunning straightline
            experience by producing enough grip to get around those gorgeous
            bends and sweeping curves. Elemental, of course, opted for the most
            elegant light-weight solution for this on the RP1 - aerodynamic
            downforce.  </p>

			<h3>So what is downforce?</h3>
			</header>
<p>Aerodynamic downforce is downwards thrust created by the aerodynamics of the car, the purpose of which is to allow a car to corner faster by increasing the vertical force on the tyres, and thereby creating more grip. The vehicle is pressed down towards the ground increasing its stability. In the schematic above, the use of a wing to generate downforce is illustrated. Downforce is created as a consequence of Newton's third law (every action has an equal and opposite reaction). Because air is a gas, the molecules are free to move about so any solid surface can turn the flow. In this case the aerofoil turns the air upwards by slowing the air on top of the wing and by accelerating the air under the wing. By turning the air upwards, by Newton's third law, the wing is pushed downwards.

                        <header>
                        <h3>An important equation</h3>
                        </header>
Above we show the most important equation in aerodynamics, the Bernoulli equation. P, represents the pressure (which is force per unit area) and V, represents the speed of the flow. Thus, we have an equation that relates pressure and flow speed. If the flow goes faster, the pressure reduces and vice versa. 
In the example of the wing generating downforce discussed above, the flow on top of the wing is slowed which increases the pressure on top of the wing. The flow on the bottom of the wing goes faster which reduces the pressure under the  wing. And because we have high pressure on top of the wing, and low pressure below the wing, we end up with a net downward force. 

            <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="/images/Elemental-pics/diffuser_scheme.png" alt="diffuser scheme" style="max-width:100%"/> </a>
                        <header>
                        <h3>How a diffuser works.</h3>
                        </header>
<p> In the diagram above  we show a schematic of a diffuser. The flow is going fast through the throat of the diffuser which gives us low pressure. We know this by applying the Bernoulli equation and in fact just like in the wing case described above the net downward force on the diffuser roof (the red line) is matched by the upward force applied to the air beside it, again applying Newton's third law.
You are now ready to understand how the RP1 generates downforce.

			<h3>How the elemental car works aerodynamically</h3>
			</header>

<p> The RP1 develops its downforce primarily using its floor geometry which is
flat with a pronounced front splitter. Its powerful front diffuser develops
suction at the front of the car and also pushes the front wheel wake losses
outboard away from the rear of the floor protecting the dramatic rear diffuser,
which generates substantial downforce at the rear of the car. And as we showed above low 
pressure is generated under the floor of the car because the diffusers push the air upwards.  A very elegant
solution, without a wing in sight to spoil the car's lines, and obtained by
some very clever packaging and a unique driving position (for a road legal
car).

			<h3>Why do we need downforce?</h3>
			</header>

<p> The image above shows a car cornering with the centrifugal force indicated
by the red arrow, illustrating the force experienced by the car when cornering.
If the car was driving on pure ice (with no grip) it would not turn the corner
- it would just keep going in a straight line. Under normal conditions the car
turns the corner by exploiting the friction
 between the tyre's contact patch and the road, which we know better as grip,
 to generate a centripetal force to counteract (or match) the centrifugal
 force.  The centrifugal force increases with speed so if we want to corner
 faster we need to generate more and more grip to increase the centripetal
 force, to balance the centrifugal force and keep the car cornering as the
 driver intended. Eventually we will reach the limit of traction at either the
 front or rear axle, leading to understeer if the front loses grip first and
 oversteer if it is the rear.  </p>

<header>
<h3>So how does downforce help?</h3>
</header>

<p>Above we show a schematic of what is happening in a corner. We have the
centrifugal force F (the arrow pulling the block to the right) which gets
larger with increasing speed. Balancing this we have the centripetal force
F<sub>fr</sub> which is proportional to N (the normal force pushing down - the
best example of this is weight). &mu; is the coefficient of friction and is a
property defined by the stickiness of the tyres and the coarseness of the road
surface.  We can see that the easiest way to increase F<sub>fr</sub> is to
increase N. You can try this at your desk. Slide your keyboard on your desk
surface. Now push down on the keyboard and try to slide it again, you will find
it is harder to slide now.  This is why Elemental wanted to increase the
downforce on the RP1,  with more downforce the car can balance the centrifugal
force at higher speeds. You could increase the normal force N by making the car
heavier. While this would work it would have the effect of reducing the
acceleration of the car (making it slower!).  So now you can see why Elemental
chose downforce as their means of increasing cornering speeds and why LCS were
delighted to help generate more.  </p>

<p> When London Computational Solutions (LCS) first heard from Elemental, they
asked for a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of their current car
with a view to understanding its aerodynamics better, so they could refine its
aerodynamic balance.  Our first milestone was to demonstrate that our CFD
modelling matched their wind tunnel data and track results. Once we had
satisfied their healthy engineering scepticism of simulation technology, which
complies with our philosophy that the first step in exploiting numerical
techniques is to prove their engineering accuracy, we moved onto the main topic
of the project - more performance. </p>

	<h3>More downforce please</h3>
</header>

<p> After a detailed debrief from the vehicle dynamicist and trackside
aerodynamics consultant, establishing that the LCS CFD results matched the
behaviour of the car on track, Elemental explained they felt they would like to
move the aerodynamic balance rearwards by about 5%.  I replied that there were
two ways of doing this, the first being to back off the front downforce and the
second being to increase the rear downforce. The immediate emphatic response
from Messieurs Begley, Fowler and Kent (the Elemental engineering directors)
was "MORE DOWNFORCE PLEASE!". This invoked a strong burst of nostalgia in my
mind, reminding me of the last time I had with worked with John, Mark and Peter
- in 2007 at McLaren F1 winning 8 World Championship races in the season.  An
achievement based on a relentless drive for more downforce. Bear in mind the
Elemental RP1 already has more than twice the downforce of any of its'
competitors, but this is  how you stay ahead - MORE MORE MORE! </p>

	<h3>A more aerodynamic car floor...</h3>
</header>

<p> The brief was now clear and LCS set off to deliver the customer's
requirement. But then came further instructions from Elemental, no appendages
were permitted (no wings sticking out!) and their packaging of the 320 bhp 2.0
litre turbo and 6 speed sequential gearbox must be respected.  Very much like
my F1 days a difficult aerodynamic challenge with tight geometric constraints.
Then came the next inevitable F1 analogy - "Mark, could you get this done in a
couple of weeks - we need to charge up the Goodwood Hill at the Festival of
Speed next month so we need some answers quickly".  And this fits perfectly
with the LCS-FAST philosophy. Our passion is for doing things FAST, in
engineering you build on what you did yesterday so if you get more done today
the better tomorrow will be. So we work FAST. </p>

	<h3>....and a <strong>fast</strong>er cornering car</h3>
</header>

<p> LCS then redesigned the rear half of the floor to surpass Elementals' targets delivering 15% more downforce and a greater than 5% shift in aerodynamic balance rearward and met the Elemental deadline. Thus the RP1 retains its stunning turn-in capabilities but now with better stability on corner entry and  even more traction on exit. This will give the RP1 >> 400 kg of downforce at 150 mph! 
See the <a href="http://elementalcars.co.uk/" target="_blank"> Elemental website</a> for more details. And as you might expect Elemental are not resting on their laurels, they are still asking for MORE so watch this space.....  </p>
