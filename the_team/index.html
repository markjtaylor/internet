												<h3><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mark-taylor-6a63397" target="_blank">Mark Taylor (CEO)</a></h3>
											</header>
        <p>Mark undertook his doctorate
	   in 3D boundary layer laminar-turbulent transition prediction techniques for supersonic transport swept wings (what should have been Concorde's replacement) in  Cambridge and then joined
Rolls-Royce Aerospace  (RR)
to design jet engine compressors. He followed this with a spell in the RR Aerothermal Methods team developing and applying aerodynamics and structural design techniques in all areas of jet engine technology.
Mark has also worked on
	   turbo-chargers, combustion, oil tankers, HVAC and acoustics and for 12 years Formula 1 Racing cars at McLaren Racing (winning 44 races out of a total of 207). He has a track-record
	   and passion for developing new fluid dynamics numerical techniques and rapidly
	   deploying them in the real world environment to improve product performance.
Mark is also a FAST runner (the reason he thinks we made him CEO), with a 10.8s 100m to his name but he tends to be a little cagey when asked if he can still do it in this time.</p>

												<h3><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gerardgorman" target="_blank">Gerard Gorman (Director)</a></h3>
											</header>

<p> Gerard has a multi-disciplinary
	   background in physics, computer science and high performance computing with a BSc in Physics, and MSc in computing and a PhD in computational Physics. He has
	   worked on applications ranging across computational fluid dynamics, seismic imaging
	   and nuclear engineering. He has delivered projects in CFD, geophysical fluid dynamics, dispersion modelling, flow through porous media, renewable and nuclear energies and fluid structure interaction. His expertise ranges across performance optimisation,
	   parallel algorithm design, model development, data science and software engineering. He loves to 
 develop software for high fidelity modelling that can run on platforms ranging from laptops to supercomputers exploiting novel techniques such as anisotropic adaptive mesh methods.
Gerard's FAST fix is downhill skiing, and his family can testify to his extreme speed (when he isn't falling over!). </p>

<p> David's research interests centre
           on the development and composition of high level abstractions for scientific
	   computation, particularly geophysical fluids. His interests span computational and
	   computer science and include both new numerical schemes and novel approaches to their
	   implementation.
 David's most recent work is on the automatic generation of finite
	   element models  for the portable solution of partial differential equations.
  David was awarded the 
           <a href="https://www.nag.co.uk/content/wilkinson-prize-numerical-software-2015-0">2015 Wilkinson Prize</a>
	   for Numerical Software.
	He is also our resident polymath with a first degree in both Mathematics and Law as well as fluency in 3 languages and a strong affection for the Opera.
